Code for PIC microcontroller electronics, mainly written for [Microchip's XC8 compiler](https://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en_us/devtools/mplabxc/).

PIC library highlights include:

 - A [driver for the ST7565 display](https://github.com/edeca/Electronics/blob/master/Include/st7565.h)
 - A [simple graphics library](https://github.com/edeca/Electronics/blob/master/Include/graphics.h) that supports proper fonts

Support scripts and files for common tasks, including:

 - A Python script to convert Proteus ARES output to [OSHPark](http://oshpark.com) format
 - XSLT files for [MuGUI](http://www.mugui.de/)
